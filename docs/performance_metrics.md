# Performance metrics

This placeholder will document the performance tests and results for the demo.

Sections to fill:
- Throughput and latency (ai_core analyze requests)
- Memory and CPU (per-service during analysis)
- Reproducibility checks (multiple runs on same dataset)
- Notes on optimizing ai_core (cached models, prebuilt wheels)
