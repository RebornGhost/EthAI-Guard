## Day 14 Preparation Recommendations

Based on Day 13 results, the following areas are ready for load testing:

1. **Load Testing Targets:**
   - Authentication endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/register)
   - Analysis endpoint (/analyze)
   - Report retrieval (/reports/:id)

2. **Performance Baselines:**
   - Establish baseline RPS (requests per second)
   - Document p95 and p99 latency values
   - Identify resource bottlenecks

3. **Monitoring Focus:**
   - Watch CPU and memory usage under load
   - Monitor database connection pools
   - Track error rates during sustained load

4. **Scaling Considerations:**
   - Consider horizontal scaling for ai_core
   - Implement request queuing for analysis jobs
   - Add caching layer for report retrieval
